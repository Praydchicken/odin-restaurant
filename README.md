# Odin Project : Restaurant Page

A restaurant page built as part of The Odin Project JavaScript Course

## Built With
- HTML / CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES modules)
- Webpack

## What I Practiced
- Webpack bundling and configuration
- DOM manipulation - building UI entirely through JavaScript
- ES modules and separating concerns by tab / page
